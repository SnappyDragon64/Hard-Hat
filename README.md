 _It's 5 AM and noise from the construction site next door is getting between you and sleep. What better way to deal with it than to bring it down?_
    
 **Hard Hat Havoc** is a tile destruction-based puzzle platformer with a stylized blend of 2D and 3D graphics. Your goal is to break through the construction site with your ball to take it down and finally get some rest.
    
 This game was made for [Road To Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/road-to-game-jam) for the theme **Everything Falls Apart**, which is reflected in the destroyable tiles that the player must break through.
    
 Levels feature mechanics such as targets, moving platforms, and springs, which must be utilized to progress.
